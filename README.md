  ## Page Rank Algorithm
    - The PageRank algorithm was first proposed to rank web pages in search results. The basic assumption is that more “important” web pages are referenced more often by other pages and thus are ranked higher. The algorithm works by considering the number and “importance” of links pointing to a page, to estimate how important that page is. PageRank outputs a probability distribution over all web pages, representing the likelihood that a person randomly surfing the web (randomly clicking on links) would arrive at those pages.
